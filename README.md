## Description

It's a minesweeper with classic rules but a step further!

As a player, you can control one of the characters at a time. To switch between characters press "SPACE". Each character has unique abilities that will allow you to progress to the next level.


Characters:

- Knight - with his shield and armor he goes first into the unknown parts of the dungeon. Use his ability to adventure through a dungeon
- Scout - thanks to his skills is able to see how many monsters are around. He can flag a spot where he thinks there is a monster.

Be careful not to hit the monster! They are too dangerous in this dungeon. Encountering one will end in certain death.

Your goal is to check the whole floor to see if it is safe.

## Rules:

Reveal a square with a knight (LEFT-CLICK) and you get a number. That number is the number of how many monsters are surrounding it. If you find the monster, you can open "unopened" squares around it, opening more areas. To remember where could be a monster flag it with scout (RIGHT-CLICK). Use scout ability a second time and you'll flag square with a question mark.
